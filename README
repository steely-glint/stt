Experiment to see if google's translation uri (as used in chromium) can be used from a java applet. Qualified success. 

I'm not making _any_ claims about any rights to use such a uri or about the quality or it's continued existance, you'll have to talk to google about that.

An example of it running (and code to use the applet) can currently be found at http://api.phonefromhere.com/stt/test.html
